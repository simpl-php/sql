# Simple/SQL

A dead-simple layer on top of PDO to make PDO setup and querying simpler

## Installation

```bash
composer require simpl/sql
```

## Coding Standards
This library uses [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://www.squizlabs.com/php-codesniffer) to ensure coding standards are followed.

I have adopted the [PHP FIG PSR-2 Coding Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) EXCEPT for the tabs vs spaces for indentation rule. PSR-2 says 4 spaces. I use tabs. No discussion.

To support indenting with tabs, I've defined a custom PSR-2 ruleset that extends the standard [PSR-2 ruleset used by PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/blob/master/CodeSniffer/Standards/PSR2/ruleset.xml). You can find this ruleset in the root of this project at PSR2Tabs.xml
